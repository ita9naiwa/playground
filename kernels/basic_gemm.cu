/*
  This example demonstrates how to call a CUTLASS GEMM kernel and provides a naive reference
  matrix multiply kernel to verify its correctness.

  The CUTLASS Gemm template is instantiated in the function CutlassSgemmNN. This is kernel computes
  the general matrix product (GEMM) using single-precision floating-point arithmetic and assumes
  all matrices have column-major layout.

  The threadblock tile size is chosen as 128x128x8 which offers good performance for large matrices.
  See the CUTLASS Parallel for All blog post for more exposition on the tunable parameters available
  in CUTLASS.

  Aside from defining and launching the SGEMM kernel, this example does not use any other components
  or utilities within CUTLASS. Such utilities are demonstrated elsewhere in other examples and are
  prevalent in the CUTLASS unit tests.

  This example has delibrately been kept similar to the basic_gemm example from cutlass-1.3 to
  highlight the minimum amount of differences needed to transition to cutlass-2.0.
